GF_0004	AACF056A	Hi Carl!
GF_0007	33C654D0	She seemed to have a good time, but she looks tired. You better take her home.
GF_0008	A3794941	The date went well! Now she wants a lift back to her place...
GF_0009	D47E79D7	She seems happy enough. Now give her a run home!
GF_0010	B4B9F032	She likes you! Next time she might go a little further...
GF_0011	C3BEC0A4	Way to go, Casanova, she's dumped you! Oh well, there are plenty more fish in the sea.
GF_0012	5AB7911E	Amateur! RULE No. 1 - NEVER drop a girl mid-date!
GF_0014	B3D4342B	This is it, she's inviting you in for coffee! Gird your loins for love...

GF_0022	719AC2DD	She wants you to drive her home! This could be it...
GF_0024	98F967E8	She wants to do a drive-by? This is one dangerous lady!
GF_0025	EFFE577E	You got a bit of a hair trigger there...
GF_0026	76F706C4	She wants to go stuff her face!
GF_0027	01F03652	She wants to cruise. Maybe she'll want to park up someplace...
GF_0028	914F2BC3	She wants to check your dance moves! The ladies like a real mover!
GF_0029	E6481B55	Fun:
GF_0031	F188A226	Uh-oh. She sounds bored. Quick, do something fun!
GF_0032	6881F39C	Ah. There you go, you see. You bored her legs shut!
GF_0033	1F86C30A	Yes, she wants another date! Soon she will be powerless to resist...
GF_0034	81E256A9	You have no idea how to treat a lady!
GF_0035	F6E5663F	Make a bit more of an effort next time!
GF_0036	6FEC3785	Pick a place that your girl might like and take her there. Choose between fast-food, restaurant, bar or diner, as indicated on the map.
GF_0037	18EB0713	Take your girl through areas she might like and watch your speed.

GF_0044	CEA3C06E	Here we go with the kinky shit...
GF_0045	B9A4F0F8	You better let her drive or she'll sulk all through the date...
GF_0047	57AA91D4	She stole your car! You two have so much in common...
GF_0048	C7158C45	Your girlfriend is not at home right now. Try again later.
GF_0049	B012BCD3	Go and get a nice car for your girlfriend!
GF_0050	D0D53536	This area seems to suit her...
GF_0051	A7D205A0	Sounds like she doesn't like this area...
GF_0052	3EDB541A	You need to show style to impress, dude!
GF_0053	49DC648C	What does she mean by, 'not fit'? What ever happened to 'a good sense of humor'?
GF_0054	D7B8F12F	You danced her socks off! Take her home and see what unfolds...
GF_0055	A0BFC1B9	Oh dear. She didn't like that place much...
GF_0056	39B69003	Your attempts at dancing embarrassed her. She was completely unimpressed!
GF_0057	4EB1A095	She doesn't look very impressed...
GF_0058	DE0EBD04	You're starting to impress the lady!
GF_0059	A9098D92	She's hooked on your moves, Mr. Groove!

GF_0063	62F1374F	You picked her kind of place!
GF_0064	FC95A2EC	Step up, holmes, she wants to dance!
GF_0065	8B92927A	She REALLY liked that place!
GF_0066	129BC3C0	Oh dear, it doesn't sound like she had a good time...
GF_0067	659CF356	Failure to satisfy a woman is a CRIME!
GF_0068	F523EEC7	She doesn't sound too pissed - she must have such low self esteem!
GF_0069	8224DE51	Time to park up and get to first base!

MSWE05E	6B40678C	But there's no need to let yourself go, CJ.
MSWE05F	F2493636	So I put a little weight on, but....
MSWE05G	854E06A0	There's a gym I go to just up a couple of blocks from the Grove.
MSWE05H	15F11B31	Go check it out.
MSWE05J	FBFF7A1D	OK, I'm gonna see what's up, man.

MSWE06E	406D344F	You're too skinny, CJ, you need to pack on some muscle!
MSWE06F	D96465F5	If I wanted nagging, I'd buy a clockwork wife!
MSWE06G	AE635563	Just looking out for you, homie.
MSWE06H	3EDC48F2	It's all show and respect, you know?
MSWE06J	D0D229DE	Yeah, I guess.
MSWE06K	A7D51948	There's a gym I go to a couple of blocks out from the Grove.
MSWE06L	39B18CEB	Go check it out and get yo'self a gangsta's physique.
MSWE06M	4EB6BC7D	Later, man.
MSWE06N	D7BFEDC7	I'll scope it out.

MSWE07A	5E1BC117	Speak.
MSWE07B	C71290AD	I thought you was representing?
MSWE07C	B015A03B	What?
MSWE07D	2E713598	Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought you was rolling with Grove Street again.
MSWE07E	5976050E	Already told you I am!
MSWE07F	C07F54B4	Well I ain't seen you in yo' colors yet!
MSWE07G	B7786422	You gotta fly the flag, man!

MSWE07J	C9C9189F	Alright man, my bad. I just ain't got around to it yet.
MSWE07K	BECE2809	There's a Binco around the corner from the gym in Ganton, go get yourself some greens!
MSWE08A	D983DDD8	Whattup, bro?
MSWE08B	408A8C62	CJ, I been thinking.
MSWE08C	378DBCF4	The city's big, but it ain't that big.
MSWE08D	A9E92957	Some fools know where Smoke's hiding.
MSWE08E	DEEE19C1	but as long as the Grove Street Families don't rule the streets,
MSWE08F	47E7487B	his money is going to mean more than our rep.
MSWE08G	30E078ED	What you got in mind?
MSWE08H	A05F657C	We gotta hit those Ballas and Vagos with everything,
MSWE08J	4E510450	Hit every neighborhood they got!
MSWE08K	395634C6	If that's the only way, I'm down for that!
MSWE08L	A732A165	I'm gonna see what I can find out on the streets.
MSWE08M	D03591F3	Much love, bro.

MSWE09A	C098EC99	Carl, it's Sweet!
MSWE09B	5991BD23	Hey wassup, you find Smoke?
MSWE09C	2E968DB5	After we dumped on those Ballas the Vagos started to speak.
MSWE09E	C7F52880	We've got him now!
MSWE09F	5EFC793A	He's hiding in Los Flores, or East Los Santos.
MSWE09G	29FB49AC	Time to saddle up, CJ!
MSWE09H	B944543D	Alright, I'll get you, and then we'll roll over there.
MSWE10A	10983DE7	Hello?

MSWE10D	60F2C968	Thought I'd explain some shit.
MSWE10E	17F5F9FE	Since you been away, shit has changed 'round here.
MSWE10F	8EFCA844	Grove Street Families ain't big no more.
MSWE10G	F9FB98D2	Seville Boulevard Families and Temple Drive Families are beefing, and split with the Grove.
MSWE10H	69448543	Now we so busy set tripping, Ballas and Vagos have taken over, so watch yo'self out there.
MSWE10J	874AE46F	Just because they're wearing greens, don't mean they're allies. Copy?
MSWE10K	F04DD4F9	Yeah, I hear you.
MSWE10L	6E29415A	Thanks for the heads up.

MSWE11H	705FB402	A'ight, man, I gotta go.
MSWE11J	9E51D52E	Don't worry bro, I ain't gonna leave you in there.
MSWE12A	22AE5F65	Carl, what's up? It's your brother.
MSWE12B	BBA70EDF	Eh, what's up, man, you OK?
MSWE12C	CCA03E49	Not really.
MSWE12D	52C4ABEA	I'm stuck in a cell between two lunatics.

MSWE12H	5B72E7C1	No, she's looking after me!
MSWE12J	B57C86ED	Right, right, that's cool.

MSWE12L	5C1F23D8	No you ain't, nigga.
MSWE12M	2B18134E	I'm in for life! I guess I've grown used to it now.
MSWE12N	B21142F4	Who do you think you are?
MSWE12O	C5167262	No you not, man, I'm working shit out.
MSWE12P	481E7F97	Whatever it takes.
MSWE12Q	3F194F01	That's a negative. I'm through hoping.

MTOR04A	F56D1109	Hey Carl! So what do you think of our new base of operations?
MTOR04B	6C6440B3	It's missing something.
MTOR04C	1B637025	Maybe a tennis court and a pool would help motivate me better.
MTOR04D	8507E586	Very nice Carl, very cute.
MTOR04E	F200D510	Now listen, you're going to have to learn how to fly.
MTOR04F	6B0984AA	No I ain't.
MTOR04G	1C0EB43C	Yes, actually, you are.
MTOR04H	8CB1A9AD	I've set out a series of tests for you. You can access them on that TV.
MTOR04J	62BFC881	You're going to have to prove to me you can fly
MTOR04K	15B8F817	if you're going to continue working towards your brother's freedom.

MTOR05F	7212B5EB	Until you've walked into the middle of Bedouin arms dealer's camp with nothing but a briefcase full of cash,
MTOR05G	0515857D	you don't know the meaning of fear, okay?
MTOR05H	95AA98EC	Oh yeah? Try going to the swap meet in Idlewood sometime.

MTOR06E	C036B792	I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Carl
MTOR06F	593FE628	The one difference between those that tried and died
MTOR06G	2E38D6BE	and those that still walk this Earth, is belief in self
MTOR06H	BE87CB2F	Nothing is impossible, Carl.
MTOR06J	5089AA03	Beat your fears, focus your mind and learn to fly.
MTOR06K	278E9A95	OK, OK, I'll-
MTOR06L	B9EA0F36	TORENO?
MTOR06M	CEED3FA0	Oh shit...
MTOR06N	57E46E1A	I guess I'm not a natural pilot, that's all.
MTOR07A	DE4042CA	Toreno?
MTOR07B	47491370	Carl, learn to fly.
MTOR07C	304E23E6	I'm on it, man, I swear.
MTOR07D	AE2AB645	I'm on it man I swear', same old broken record, Carl. But that's fine...
MTOR07E	D92D86D3	because your brother's getting a new cell mate tonight.
MTOR07F	4024D769	Shit dude, OK, OK, I swear man, I'm gonna be the best pilot!
MTOR07G	3723E7FF	I'd love to hear you Carl, I can't hear you. All I can hear is your brother's love cries
MTOR07H	A79CFA6E	Wait! Please, man!
MTOR07J	49929B42	that was my last motivational speech, understand? Am I being too spiritual for you, Carl?
MTOR07K	3E95ABD4	OK, man, I get the message!
MTOR07L	A0F13E77	Horse Cock Harry, And I'm sending a present, little wedding present.
MTOR07M	D7F60EE1	Big tub of lube!

SHRK_1A	3D050704	Hey, Mr. Johnson. Just a friendly reminder that you owe me money.
SHRK_1B	A40C56BE	Don't be a stranger.
SHRK_2A	162854C7	Hello, Carl Johnson.
SHRK_2B	8F21057D	You owe me money and I would consider it polite if you paid it back, understand?
SHRK_3A	0F336586	Mr. Carl Johnson. My records show that you owe me money.
SHRK_3B	963A343C	Probably just slipped your mind, but I thought I'd just jog your memory.
SHRK_4A	4072F341	Mr. Johnson! I haven't seen you for a while, and you owe me money!
SHRK_4B	D97BA2FB	Consider your position and that of your friends and family!
SHRK_5A	5969C200	Carl! I hope you're not spending too much cash. Especially since you've owed me money for so long.
SHRK_5B	C06093BA	Don't make an enemy of me, Carl.
SHRK_6A	724491C3	Carl Johnson. I hear you have a sister.
SHRK_6B	EB4DC079	Don't make me explain to her why you owe me so much money!
SHRK_7A	6B5FA082	I'm a patient man, Mr. Johnson, but I'm also a businessman, understand?
SHRK_7B	F256F138	You owe me money, Carl, think about it.
SHRK_8A	ECC7BC4D	Mr. Johnson, you owe me money.
SHRK_8B	75CEEDF7	A business relationship is built on trust and mutual respect. Think about it.
SHRK_9A	F5DC8D0C	Mr. Johnson, I hear you're in the neighborhood!
SHRK_9B	6CD5DCB6	Some of my associates will be paying you a visit to talk about your debts.
SHRK10A	6657D06F	Carl Johnson. Little bird told me you're in town.
SHRK10B	FF5E81D5	You should have listened to me and paid your debts.
SHRK11A	7F4CE12E	A man of honor pays his debts, Mr. Johnson.
SHRK11B	E645B094	You've left me no choice but to treat you with the same lack of respect you've shown me.
SHRK12A	5461B2ED	I am not a charity, Mr. Johnson, I'm a businessman.
SHRK12B	CD68E357	You should have paid up while you had the chance.
SHRK13A	4D7A83AC	Mr. Johnson, I want my fucking money!
SHRK13B	D473D216	I'm sending someone round to pay you a little courtesy call.
SHRK14A	023B156B	I don't think you're getting the message, Mr. Johnson: I WANT MY MONEY!
SHRK14B	9B3244D1	I'll let you negotiate with my, eh, collection department.
SHRK15A	1B20242A	The time for pleasantries is past, Mr. Johnson.
SHRK15B	82297590	You've given me no choice but to get a little more persuasive about your debt problems.
